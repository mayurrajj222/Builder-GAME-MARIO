# This would be a binary file - you should replace this with actual icon files
# For now, the game will use the player sprite from your assets as the icon
# You can create proper .ico, .icns, and .png icons using tools like:
# - https://iconverticons.com/
# - Photoshop/GIMP
# - Online icon generators

# Use your player character sprite as the app icon!
